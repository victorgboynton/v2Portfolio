				This project involved creating a website for a charity named{" "}
				<strong>&apos;Hopeful Humans&apos;</strong>. The goal was to design a
				platform that not only serves the charity&apos;s needs but also stands
				as a testament to my skills and dedication.
			</p>
			<p>
				Leveraging technologies like React, TailwindCSS, and Nextjs, I focused
				on building an intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing site.
			</p>
			<p>
				My aspiration for this project is for it to be recognized as the magnum
				opus of my portfolio, showcasing my technical abilities and my
				commitment to using technology for social good.
